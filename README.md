Executive Summary:
The objective of this report is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for detecting credit card fraud. Key findings include insights into the characteristics of fraudulent transactions and recommendations for improving fraud detection systems.

Data Description:
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

Data processing:
Steps like checking for missing values , undersampling and handling imbalanced data was done.

Model Building (Logistic Regression):
A logistic regression model is trained using the preprocessed data.

Model evaluation:
Accuracy of both test and train set is checked and future predictions are made using the trained model
